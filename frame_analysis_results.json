  "ground_truth": "A direct continuation of the existing shot of a child coloring a dragon on paper. Begin with the crayon already mid-stroke, camera pushing slowly inward at the same steady pace and low desk-level angle. After three seconds, the drawing peels gently from the page and rises into three-dimensional space, wax lines smoking off as the dragon blinks awake. Maintain the 35 mm macro tilt-shift lens with gentle focus fall-off and Pearlescent 1/4 filtration, preserving the soft pastel texture and subsurface scatter of the paper. The child's desk and lighting should remain consistent in color and tone, with the transformation unfolding seamlessly as if no cut occurred.",

A child holds a turquoise crayon mid-stroke, coloring the dragon\u2019s tail. The dragon\u2019s right wing has peeled off the paper into 3D form, green with red outlining, and now its head begins to lift, both edged with smoking wax. Warm desk-lamp light bathes the scene, and the background remains softly blurred, seamlessly blending drawing and emerging creature.",

      "frame_description": "From a low desk-level vantage, a child\u2019s hand grips a turquoise crayon mid-stroke as they color the wing of a whimsical dragon illustration on white paper. The foreground shows a few out-of-focus pastel crayons lying on the wooden desk. In the background, a warm, softly glowing desk lamp and a blurred glass jar contribute to consistent, warm lighting. A shallow depth of field and gentle focus fall-off\u2014characteristic of a 35 mm macro tilt-shift setup\u2014accentuate the waxy crayon texture and the subtle subsurface scatter of the paper.",

The camera remains at a low, desk-level angle with a macro tilt-shift lens, preserving soft pastel textures and consistent warm lighting. In this frame, the child\u2019s hand applies turquoise crayon to the dragon\u2019s wing mid-stroke, setting the stage for the imminent moment when the illustrated dragon will begin to peel off the page.",

      "frame_description": "The frame shows a close-up at desk level of a child\u2019s right hand holding a turquoise crayon mid-stroke as they color the dragon\u2019s wing. The dragon sketch has a purple outline, pink and yellow body gradients, and partially filled turquoise wings. A warm desk lamp illuminates the paper from above-left, creating soft pastel highlights and a gentle focus fall-off at the top and bottom edges. In the blurred background are a glass jar (possibly for water or brushes), a box of crayons or pastels, and the brass base of the lamp. The shot maintains a shallow depth of field consistent with a 35 mm macro tilt-shift lens and Pearlescent 1/4 filtration, preserving the paper\u2019s subsurface scatter and warm tone.",
      "updated_summary": "The video continues with a smooth inward camera push at a low, desk-level angle using a macro tilt-shift lens with soft focus fall-off. The child remains coloring a dragon drawing with a turquoise crayon mid-stroke. The soft pastel texture of the paper and consistent warm desk lamp lighting persist. The stage is set for the dragon to soon peel off the page in three-dimensional form.",

The dragon\u2019s right wing is visibly curling up off the page into three-dimensional space, its waxy edge lifting and flickering faint wisps of smoke above. The desk surface has a soft pastel texture, and out-of-focus crayons and a warm desk lamp are visible in the blurred background. The shallow depth of field and gentle focus fall-off around the edges indicate the use of a macro tilt-shift lens under warm, consistent desk lighting.",

In the foreground, the paper dragon\u2019s right wing stands fully erect in three-dimensional form, its green and red-outlined membrane catching the soft light. Wisps of smoke drift upward from the wax along the wing\u2019s edge. Behind it, the dragon\u2019s head now arches slightly off the paper, with colored lines and shading matching the rest of the drawing. To the right, the child\u2019s hand grips a turquoise crayon, mid-stroke along the dragon\u2019s tail.
