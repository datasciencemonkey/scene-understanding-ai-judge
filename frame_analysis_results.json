  "ground_truth": "A direct continuation of the existing shot of a child coloring a dragon on paper. Begin with the crayon already mid-stroke, camera pushing slowly inward at the same steady pace and low desk-level angle. After three seconds, the drawing peels gently from the page and rises into three-dimensional space, wax lines smoking off as the dragon blinks awake. Maintain the 35 mm macro tilt-shift lens with gentle focus fall-off and Pearlescent 1/4 filtration, preserving the soft pastel texture and subsurface scatter of the paper. The child's desk and lighting should remain consistent in color and tone, with the transformation unfolding seamlessly as if no cut occurred.",

The dragon\u2019s right wing has fully curved upward into three-dimensional space, and its neck and head have peeled off the paper, blinking awake as wisps of wax smoke rise from its edges. The child\u2019s right hand still holds a green crayon mid-stroke. The soft pastel texture, subsurface scattering of the paper, and warm tone remain consistent, with the 35 mm macro tilt-shift aesthetic preserved through shallow depth of field and gentle focus fall-off.",

      "frame_description": "A low, desk-level close-up shows a child\u2019s hand gripping a teal crayon mid-stroke as they color the wing of a whimsical dragon sketched on paper. The warm glow of a desk lamp illuminates the desk surface, while the background remains softly blurred by a shallow depth of field (tilt-shift style). Other crayons lie scattered in the foreground and background, and the paper\u2019s pastel texture and subtle subsurface scattering are clearly visible. The composition suggests the camera is pushing slowly inward, maintaining a soft focus fall-off around the edges.",
      "updated_summary": "The shot continues seamlessly from the previous scene: a child is coloring a dragon drawing on a wooden desk under a warm lamp. The camera, at a low desk-level angle with a 35 mm macro tilt-shift look, is pushing closer, capturing the crayon mid-stroke and preserving soft pastel textures and focus fall-off. The scene remains consistent in lighting, tone, and desk setup, setting up the forthcoming transformation of the dragon from 2D art into a three-dimensional form.",

The dragon illustration features soft pastel outlines in purple and teal. A warm desk lamp glows in the blurred background, casting a gentle, even light on the wooden surface. The shallow depth of field and soft focus fall-off on the edges convey the 35 mm macro tilt-shift look, preserving the paper\u2019s subtle texture and the crayons\u2019 waxy sheen.",

That wing has begun to peel up off the paper, folding into three-dimensional space with soft pastel surfaces. Wisps of semi-transparent smoke spiral upward from the wax lines.

The dragon\u2019s right wing stands fully upright in three-dimensional space, edged with colored crayon and faint smoke curling upward from the wax. The dragon\u2019s neck and head have peeled free and are hovering just above the page, its eyes opening in a gentle blink. In the blurred background, a warm lamp glows out of focus, casting soft, warm light across the paper\u2019s texture.
