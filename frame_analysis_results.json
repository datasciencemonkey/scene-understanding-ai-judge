  "ground_truth": "A direct continuation of the existing shot of a child coloring a dragon on paper. Begin with the crayon already mid-stroke, camera pushing slowly inward at the same steady pace and low desk-level angle. After three seconds, the drawing peels gently from the page and rises into three-dimensional space, wax lines smoking off as the dragon blinks awake. Maintain the 35 mm macro tilt-shift lens with gentle focus fall-off and Pearlescent 1/4 filtration, preserving the soft pastel texture and subsurface scatter of the paper. The child's desk and lighting should remain consistent in color and tone, with the transformation unfolding seamlessly as if no cut occurred.",

A warm desk lamp overhead softly illuminates the scene. The background and foreground are gently blurred, suggesting a shallow depth of field with focus fall-off consistent with a 35 mm macro tilt-shift lens. The paper\u2019s pastel texture is visible, and crayons lie scattered on the desk in matching warm tones.",
      "updated_summary": "The video begins with a steady, low-angle close-up of a child coloring a pastel dragon drawing on paper with a green crayon under a warm desk lamp. The camera employs a slow inward push and a shallow depth of field reminiscent of a 35 mm macro tilt-shift lens. At this point, the dragon artwork remains flat on the page, with no three-dimensional transformation yet.",

The warm desk lamp overhead casts a soft pool of golden light that falls off gently into shadow, and the shallow depth of field (characteristic of a 35 mm macro tilt-shift lens) blurs the background, where other crayons lie scattered. The pastel texture of the paper is visible, and the outlines of the purple-inked dragon remain flat on the page with no three-dimensional elements yet.",

The camera performs a slow inward push using a 35 mm macro tilt-shift lens with soft focus fall-off and Pearlescent filtration, preserving the pastel textures. In this second frame, the child\u2019s hand is shown applying turquoise crayon to the dragon\u2019s wing. The dragon remains flat on the page, the scene consistent in color, tone, and lighting, setting up for the imminent transformation.",
