        "prompt": "A direct continuation of the existing shot of a child coloring a dragon on paper. Begin with the crayon already mid-stroke, camera pushing slowly inward at the same steady pace and low desk-level angle. After three seconds, the drawing peels gently from the page and rises into three-dimensional space, wax lines smoking off as the dragon blinks awake. Maintain the 35 mm macro tilt-shift lens with gentle focus fall-off and Pearlescent 1/4 filtration, preserving the soft pastel texture and subsurface scatter of the paper. The child's desk and lighting should remain consistent in color and tone, with the transformation unfolding seamlessly as if no cut occurred.",
